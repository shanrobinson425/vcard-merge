# vCard Merge

*One contact file from several exports.*

## About

**vCard Merge** is a desktop utility. Merge vCard files and drop duplicate emails.

Phone and mail exports overlap on email.

Point it at a path, preview the plan if you want, then write the result next to the source or to `--out`.

## Editions

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Features

- Merge vcf
- Dedupe by email
- Keeps the first display name
- Writes one vcf

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
